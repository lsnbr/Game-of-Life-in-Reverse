# Game of Life (in Reverse)

This is a Tkinter/Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
But besides normally running the simulation, you can also search for predecessors of a given pattern (running the simulation backwards).
Also supported is import/export of life patterns.


## How to use

You can run the program by downloading the repository and then running the *main.py* file

```
> git clone https://github.com/lsnbr/Game-of-Life-in-Reverse/
> cd Game-of-Life-in-Reverse
> python main.py
```

If you are on Windows, you can also just download the executable from releases.
